# PR3 Hotel Management System

Software Engineers: Michael Granberry, Raymond Babayans, Ralph Frem, Ziv Gabay


Our project will allow the front desk employee to perform necessary operations such as check-in/check-out of a guest, view a report of available/occupied rooms, and look up the name of a particular guest along with their room number. In terms of limitations, the hotelâ€™s capacity is only 40 rooms, and it accepts guests who are 18 years or older. All the required information will be stored in a local or potentially online database.
